# Holberton School - C Programming - Variables, If, Else, While

This project contains solutions to several C programming tasks. All code is written in C and fully complies with Betty coding style.

## Tasks

### 1. Print single-digit numbers (0-9)

- **Goal:** Print all single-digit base 10 numbers starting from 0.
- **Requirements:**  
  - Use only the `putchar` function for output.  
  - No variables of type `char` allowed.  
  - Maximum of 2 calls to `putchar`.  
  - All code must be inside the `main` function.

---

### 2. Print lowercase alphabet in reverse

- **Goal:** Print the lowercase alphabet from `z` to `a` in reverse order.
- **Requirements:**  
  - Use `putchar` function only.  
  - Code must be inside the `main` function.  
  - Maximum of 2 calls to `putchar`.

---

### 3. Print all numbers of base 16 in lowercase

- **Goal:** Print all hexadecimal digits (0 to f) in lowercase.
- **Requirements:**  
  - Use `putchar` function only.  
  - Maximum of 3 calls to `putchar`.  
  - All code inside the `main` function.

---

### 4. Print all single-digit numbers separated by comma and space

- **Goal:** Print numbers 0 through 9 separated by a comma followed by a space.
- **Requirements:**  
  - Use only the `putchar` function.  
  - Maximum of 4 calls to `putchar`.  
  - No variables of type `char`.  
  - All code inside the `main` function.

---

### 5. Print all alphabets in lowercase and uppercase

- **Goal:** Print all alphabets in lowercase followed by uppercase letters.
- **Requirements:**  
  - Use only `putchar`.  
  - Must print all letters sequentially.  
  - All code inside `main`.

---

### 6. Print lowercase alphabet in reverse

- **Goal:** Print the lowercase alphabet in reverse (`z` to `a`).
- **Requirements:**  
  - Use only `putchar`.  
  - All code inside the `main` function.  
  - Maximum of 2 calls to `putchar`.

---

### 7. Print all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0

- **Goal:** Print all numbers 0 through 9.
- **Requirements:**  
  - Use only `putchar`.  
  - All code inside the `main` function.  
  - Maximum of 2 calls to `putchar`.

---

### 8. Print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by comma and space

- **Goal:** Print numbers 0 through 9 separated by comma and space.
- **Requirements:**  
  - Use only `putchar`.  
  - Maximum of 4 calls to `putchar`.  
  - No variables of type `char`.  
  - All code inside `main`.

---

### 9. Print all possible combinations of two digits numbers without repetition

- **Goal:** Print all combinations of two digits from 0 to 9 without repeating the same pair (e.g., 01, 02,..., 89).
- **Requirements:**  
  - Use only `putchar`.  
  - Maximum of 5 calls to `putchar`.  
  - No variables of type `char`.  
  - All code inside `main`.

---

## General requirements

- **Coding style:** Code must follow Betty coding style perfectly.
- **Formatting:**  
  - Opening braces `{` should be on a new line.  
  - Use tabs for indentation, no spaces.  
  - No trailing whitespace allowed.
- **Variable types:** Some tasks disallow the use of `char` variables.
- **Output:** Only `putchar` can be used for printing output.
